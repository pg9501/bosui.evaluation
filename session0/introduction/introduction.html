        <div class="md-display-1">Brief Introduction</div>

        <div style="margin-top: 20px">In this experiment, you will be presented with two user interfaces:</div>
        <div style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 20px"><u>Building Operating System User Interface (BOS UI)</u> and <u>Energy Smart Home Lab Graphical User Interface (ESHL GUI)</u></div>
        <div style=" margin-top: 20px" class="md-title">
            <div>Both are user interfaces for energy management in Smart Building. They provide residents with transparent information on energy consumption
                and energy generation in their building as well as control over their appliances.</div>
            <div style=" margin-top: 20px">BOS UI supports role-based access control. There are three roles in BOS UI: <font style="font-weight: bold">Administrator</font>, who is responsible for configuring the building.
                <font style="font-weight: bold">Operator</font>, who is responsible
                for managing residents in the building and paying the electricity bill. <font style="font-weight: bold">Resident</font>, who is living in the building and use the appliances on a daily basis.</div>
            <div style=" margin-top: 20px">In ESHL GUI, there is only one role, which is equivalent to the role of residents in BOS UI.</div>
        </div>
        <div style="margin-top: 20px">Now we will ask you to do some tasks for both user interfaces. Each task will have a time limit. When the time is up,
            it will automatically move to the next task. The purpose of this is to make sure you have time to go through all the tasks, so take it easy.
            If you finish the task before the end of time, please click the button <font style="font-weight: bold">NEXT</font> to continue the next task.</div>
